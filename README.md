- I’m interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Biology. 
- I’m currently revisiting and strengthening my Computer Science understanding. I have been using python to solve problems through codebasics and rosalind. 
- I graduated from Appalachian State University in 2018 with a BS in Cell & Molecular Biology, and a minor in Computer Science. At the end of my degree, I was facinated with viral vectors as a means of targeted treatment of severe health issues. Specifically utilizing miRNA profiles as an early-stage detection and potentially a minimally-harmful treatment for cancer. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was an exciting development for this field.
- I have taken a short gap after earning my BS in order to be confident and capable I can fully commit to a graduate degree and move into work.
- I am preparing for a MS in Computer Science with Thesis, with the goal of learning Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and more.
